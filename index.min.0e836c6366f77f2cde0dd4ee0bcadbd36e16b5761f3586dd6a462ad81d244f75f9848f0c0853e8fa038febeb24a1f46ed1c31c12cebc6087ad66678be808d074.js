One of the main ones that\u0026rsquo;s used in Switzerland for designating the difficulties for hiking trails are the so-called \u0026ldquo;SAC Berg- und Alpinwanderskala\u0026rdquo; which roughly translates to \u0026ldquo;SAC Mountain and Alpine Hiking Scale\u0026rdquo;; this is a scale from T1 (easiest) to T6 (most difficult). Routes listed with a \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; indicate tours which are above an average level of difficulty for that class (so a T4+ is more difficult than a T4, but not quite in T5 territory yet).\nBelow is a rough English translation of what each of these difficulty levels entails.2 For full details, check out the original SAC difficulty designations here.\n   Difficulty Characteristics Requirements     T1 Hike  Well constructed path/roadIf present, exposed sections are very well securedDanger of falling is under normal circumstances very minimal Basic mobilityRunning shoes are suitableNavigation is unproblematic   T2 Mountain Hike  Trail with continuous pathTerrain is partly steepDanger of falls not out of the question Somewhat surefootedTrekking shoes recommendedElementary navigation skills   T3 Difficult Mountain Hike  Path not necessarily continuously visibleExposed areas can be secured with ropes or chainsMay need hands for balanceSome exposed areas with danger of fallsScree plains SurefootedGood trekking shoesAverage orientation skillsElementary alpine experience   T4 Alpine Hike  Potentially pathlessMay need hands to traverse certain passagesTerrain is quite exposed and can contain steep grass slopes, crags, simple firn fields, and snowy glacier passages. Familiar with exposed terrainSturdy trekking shoesStrong terrain assessment and orientation skillsAlpine experienceIf weather changes, it can be difficult to retreat   T5 Difficult Alpine Hike  Often pathlessContain some easy climbing passagesExposed and demanding terrainFirn fields and glacier passages with increased exposure Experience in high alpine terrainMountaineering bootsVery good terrain assessment and orientation skillsBasic knowledge of handling of pickaxes and rope   T6 Very Difficult Alpine Hike (Generally not marked) Normally pathlessModerately difficult climbing sectionsOften extremely exposedPrecarious ridge passagesGlacier passages with increased exposure Extensive high alpine experienceExcellent navigation skillsExperienced with various mountaineering tools    These difficulty ratings assume that the tour is performed under optimal conditions. This means things like:\n Good weather Dry terrain Good snow conditions Etc.  A common misconception is that T5 or T6 hikes are less difficult than \u0026ldquo;easy\u0026rdquo; high alpine tours (these use a different difficulty scale). Many T5 or T6 tours have little to no opportunities to secure oneself the way one may be able to on easier high alpine routes which makes it imperative that one has absolute mastery over alpine environments. Typical examples of such terrains include extremely steep grass slopes, unmarked routes along unstable scree slopes, or very exposed ridge traverses. Due to the different attributes which are used to characterize high alpine routes and hiking trails, there is certainly overlap in terms of \u0026ldquo;absolute difficulty\u0026rdquo; between both hiking and high alpine tours.\nSome Useful (Mostly German) Geographic Words to Know # There are a lot of words that you\u0026rsquo;ll likely come across when people list the names of different places in the mountains. Here are a few common terms/prefixes that might be useful to know:\n Canton: The Swiss version of a \u0026ldquo;state\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;province\u0026rdquo;. ＿horn: A type of pyramid shaped mountain; usually with 3 or 4 distinct faces. Formed through glacial erosion on each face, so they\u0026rsquo;re usually at fairly high elevations. Piz ＿: Similar meaning to \u0026ldquo;horn\u0026rdquo;; typically used in the Canton of Graubünden (eastern Switzerland) ＿stock: Another name for a certain peak; are usually (but not always) at lower elevations than horns. ＿spitz: Literally means \u0026ldquo;point\u0026rdquo;; does not really give an indication to how high the mountain is. ＿joch: A saddle or gully between two peaks. ＿pass: Usually a road that connects two valleys. These often serve as connection points to go from one Canton to another. ＿tal: Means \u0026ldquo;valley\u0026rdquo;. ＿gletscher: Means \u0026ldquo;glacier\u0026rdquo;. ＿firn: Snow that stays all-year round without melting but has not yet turned to ice to form a glacier. ＿see: Means \u0026ldquo;lake\u0026rdquo;. ＿hütte SAC: \u0026ldquo;Hütte\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;hut\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;SAC\u0026rdquo; stands for \u0026ldquo;Swiss Alpine Club\u0026rdquo;; you can stay overnight at these. The food they provide is usually awesome as well. 10/10 would recommend.
