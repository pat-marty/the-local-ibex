One of the main ones that\u0026rsquo;s used in Switzerland for designating the difficulties for hiking trails are the so-called \u0026ldquo;SAC Berg- und Alpinwanderskala\u0026rdquo; which roughly translates to \u0026ldquo;SAC Mountain and Alpine Hiking Scale\u0026rdquo;; this is a scale from T1 (easiest) to T6 (most difficult). Routes listed with a \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; indicate tours which are above an average level of difficulty for that class (so a T4+ is more difficult than a T4, but not quite in T5 territory yet).\nBelow is a rough English translation of what each of these difficulty levels entails.2 For full details, check out the original SAC difficulty designations here.\n   Difficulty Characteristics Requirements     T1 Hike  Well constructed path/roadIf present, exposed sections are very well securedDanger of falling is under normal circumstances very minimal Basic mobilityRunning shoes are suitableNavigation is unproblematic   T2 Mountain Hike  Trail with continuous pathTerrain is partly steepDanger of falls not out of the question Somewhat surefootedTrekking shoes recommendedElementary navigation skills   T3 Difficult Mountain Hike  Path not necessarily continuously visibleExposed areas can be secured with ropes or chainsMay need hands for balanceSome exposed areas with danger of fallsScree plains SurefootedGood trekking shoesAverage orientation skillsElementary alpine experience   T4 Alpine Hike  Potentially pathlessMay need hands to traverse certain passagesTerrain is quite exposed and can contain steep grass slopes, crags, simple firn fields, and snowy glacier passages. Familiar with exposed terrainSturdy trekking shoesStrong terrain assessment and orientation skillsAlpine experienceIf weather changes, it can be difficult to retreat   T5 Difficult Alpine Hike  Often pathlessContain some easy climbing passagesExposed and demanding terrainFirn fields and glacier passages with increased exposure Experience in high alpine terrainMountaineering bootsVery good terrain assessment and orientation skillsBasic knowledge of handling of ice axes and rope   T6 Very Difficult Alpine Hike (Generally not marked) Normally pathlessModerately difficult climbing sectionsOften extremely exposedPrecarious ridge passagesGlacier passages with increased exposure Extensive high alpine experienceExcellent navigation skillsExperienced with various mountaineering tools    These difficulty ratings assume that the tour is performed under optimal conditions. This means things like:\n Good weather Dry terrain Good snow conditions Etc.  A common misconception is that T5 or T6 hikes are less difficult than \u0026ldquo;easy\u0026rdquo; high alpine tours (these use a different difficulty scale). Many T5 or T6 tours have little to no opportunities to secure oneself the way one may be able to on easier high alpine routes which makes it imperative that one has absolute mastery over alpine environments. Typical examples of such terrains include extremely steep grass slopes, unmarked routes along unstable scree slopes, or very exposed ridge traverses. Due to the different attributes which are used to characterize high alpine routes and hiking trails, there is certainly overlap in terms of \u0026ldquo;absolute difficulty\u0026rdquo; between both hiking and high alpine tours.\nSome Useful (Mostly German) Geographic Words to Know # There are a lot of words that you\u0026rsquo;ll likely come across when people list the names of different places in the mountains. Here are a few common terms/prefixes that might be useful to know:\n Canton: The Swiss version of a \u0026ldquo;state\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;province\u0026rdquo;. ＿horn: A type of pyramid shaped mountain; usually with 3 or 4 distinct faces. Formed through glacial erosion on each face, so they\u0026rsquo;re usually at fairly high elevations. Piz ＿: Similar meaning to \u0026ldquo;horn\u0026rdquo;; typically used in the Canton of Graubünden (eastern Switzerland) ＿stock: Another name for a certain peak; are usually (but not always) at lower elevations than horns. ＿spitz: Literally means \u0026ldquo;point\u0026rdquo;; does not really give an indication to how high the mountain is. ＿joch: A saddle or gully between two peaks. ＿pass: Usually a road that connects two valleys. These often serve as connection points to go from one Canton to another. ＿grat: Means \u0026ldquo;ridge\u0026rdquo;. ＿tal: Means \u0026ldquo;valley\u0026rdquo;. ＿gletscher: Means \u0026ldquo;glacier\u0026rdquo;. ＿firn: Snow that stays all-year round without melting but has not yet turned to ice to form a glacier. ＿see: Means \u0026ldquo;lake\u0026rdquo;. ＿hütte SAC: \u0026ldquo;Hütte\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;hut\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;SAC\u0026rdquo; stands for \u0026ldquo;Swiss Alpine Club\u0026rdquo;; you can stay overnight at these. The food they provide is usually awesome as well. 10/10 would recommend.

Drove to Fell near Oberrickenbach.  Took two very small cable cars (so-called Buiräbähnli) up to the starting point.  The first was Luftseilbahn Fell-Spis. The second was Luftseilbahn Spis-Sinsgäu.   On the way down we took the Luftseilbahn Fell-Chrüzhütte.   The ascent up to the ridge leading to the Chaiserstuel was extremely steep (marked blue-white-blue) so we were quite happy to have had our poles with us. There was only one very short (~15m) scrambling passage to get to the top of the Chaiserstuel. We hiked part-way to the Bietstöck but decided to turn around before getting to the cross because it was extremely exposed.

Yes        Overview Map Detailed Description Gallery   Quick Summary #  A fairly lengthy hike from Lü to the Piz Terza in the Val Müstair There was a nice mix of relatively chill gravel roads and some steeper hiking paths Given the relatively high elevation of the Piz Terza (2909 m), the peak had some incredible views of the surrounding mountains Beginning/end of the hike goes through a forest filled with larch trees which add a ton of colour in the autumn months   Coming soon\u0026hellip; #  Arrival in Lü # We arrived in Lü from Sta. Maria by car (about a 10-15 minute drive) and parked in the relatively large parking lot at the edge of town. However, Lü is surprisingly accessible by public transit with regular bus service going directly to the village itself.\n  The PostAuto departing from Lü. Alp Tabladatsch # The first portion of the hike was along a gravel road through the forest — amazing views with the yellow larch trees all around. We were quite surprised by how few people were on the trail here despite it being a spot which is so accessible with public transit. It was also a weekend when we were here so we really lucked out with the lack of other hikers on the trail\n  The gravel road leading to the trailhead. Pretty much the entire part up to the Alp Tabladatsch hut consisted of very well maintained gravel roads. It was only once we reached a small alp hut a stone\u0026rsquo;s throw from Alp Tabladatsch that we reached a more typical hiking path.\n  A view towards the Umbrailpass.   The transition from dirt/gravel roads to a regular hiking path. This view is looking back towards the Ofenpass  (not visible here), which is to the right of the Piz Daint (right peak). Piz Terza # This portion of the hike followed a stream up to a small lake near the Fuorcla Sassalba. Here we followed the waypoint sign to the trail leading up to the Piz Terza.\n  The junction that leads up towards the Piz Terza. This part of the trail was quite a bit steeper than the previous parts, but was not at all exposed. The path was well marked and generally unproblematic to traverse apart from a few patches of ice and snow.\n  A view back towards the Muntet (the mountain closest to us). We started hitting more frequent snow fields once we got above an elevation of around 2600m to 2700m. As mentioned though, this path was not at all exposed so these additional obstacles only resulted in the hiking times being a little longer than expected but did not otherwise impact the hike at all.\n  The final scent up to the top of the Piz Terza. Once at the top of the Piz Terza, we were met with an incredible 360° view of the surrounding mountains. While the view from yesterday\u0026rsquo;s peak on the Piz Chavalatsch was impressive, the view from the Piz Terza was on a whole other level.\n  Standing on top of the summit of the Piz Terza at 2909m above sea level.   The summit cross of the Piz Terza. We took a well deserved break at the summit, had some lunch, and enjoyed the views.\n  Not a bad lunch spot. Fuorcla Sassalba # After a short rest, we made our way back down the same path which we had taken up to the summit. We followed this path all the way back to the small lake below the Fuorcla Sassalba which we came across previously before heading up to the Piz Terza.\n  An incredible panorama view all the way down from the summit. Once we had arrived at this small alpine lake, we made our way up to the upper (and slightly larger) lake on the Fuorcla Sassalba. This alpine lake looked pretty unique in that the low seasonal water level had exposed most of the rocks which would normally otherwise be submerged below the surface of the lake. These rocks were completely covered in black algae, which gave them the appearance of having been set on fire. Really quite a unique spot.\n  An unusual alpine lake that was just beginning to freeze over. The black rocks looked like they were covered with some kind of black algae which made them really stand out against the snow and the light grasses. As expected, we encountered considerably more snow/ice while heading down the north side of the Fuorcla Sassalba when compared to our hike up on the south side. While not a dangerous descent, this definitely did slow us down somewhat. With that being said, we were met with almost entirely snow-free trails on the plains below the fuorcla which made for some quite pleasant hiking conditions across this flatter portion of the hike.\nWe followed these relatively flat plains down the valley towards the treeline. The regular grass mounds along this plain cast some fairly dramatic shadows in the afternoon sun which made for some relatively nice photographs.\n  A view back towards the Piz Terza. We followed this plain until we reached the Pass da Costainas. The path transitioned here from regular hiking paths back into gravel roads.\n  Back into the larches we go. Return to Lü # The final portion of the hike back along the gravel road heading towards Lü was mostly among the larch trees (somewhat similar to the hike we did the day before near the Piz Chavalatsch).\n  Larches all around. While a little on the longer side, this hike was absolutely beautiful and had the benefit of not being technically challenging.\n  A view of the Piz Daint on our way back to the car.   .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                                                       "}).add({id:5,href:"/docs/hiking/piz_chavalatsch/",title:"Piz Chavalatsch",description:"Autumn hike among the larch trees to the easternmost point of Switzerland.",content:"    Difficulty T3     ⇄ Distance 13.8 km   ↑ Up 1200 m   ↓ Down 1200 m   Notable Locations Piz Chavalatsch, Stelvio National Park, Sta. Maria (Val Müstair)   Public Transit Access? No        Overview Map Detailed Description Gallery   Quick Summary #  A fairly long hike on the Swiss/Italian border in the Val Müstair An abundance of larch trees made this an incredible hike to do in the autumn We were staying in Sta. Maria which was only about a ~5 minute drive to the start of the trail Lots of amazing panorama views from the ridges to/from the Piz Chavalatsch   Coming soon\u0026hellip; #  Arrival # We stayed in the Hotel Alpina in the village of Sta. Maria having arrived the evening before. The drive to the starting point of this hike only took around 10 minutes from Sta. Maria which made this quite convenient to access. The road leading up to the starting point was labelled as an \u0026ldquo;off-road\u0026rdquo; route but there was indeed small parking lot at the end of the road (I\u0026rsquo;d say there\u0026rsquo;s probably room for about 5 or 6 cars).\nAscent Among the Larches # The first part of the hike consists of hiking through the forest among the larch trees. For the uninitiated, larch trees are conifer trees that turn bright yellow in the autumn. This only happens for a very short period of time in the autumn; the needles fall off of the larch trees not too long after they turn yellow.\n  The larch trees turn a bright yellow at this time of year. The colours hiking up through the forest for this part of the trail was absolutely incredible — this kind of trail was the primary reason why we came to this part of Switzerland at this time of year. Definitely worth seeing if you get an opportunity!\n  A slow and steady incline up to the treeline. Once we had gotten to a sufficient elevation, we started to peek above the forest and had an absolutely incredible view over the Val Müstair.\n  A view down the Val Müstair. Overall, this part of the trail was pretty unproblematic. The elevation gain was pretty consistent and there weren\u0026rsquo;t any exposed spots. Since this part of the hike was pretty much all in the shade, much of the ground was still frozen from the cold evening before.\n  Our first rays of sunshine. Ascent to the Piz Chavalatsch # The next part of the hike first went across a flat plain just above the treeline. Most of the grass here had already turned orange/yellow which really complemented well with the colour of the larches below us.\n  Our first view of the Piz Chavalatsch on the left-hand-side; the summit cross can just be made out on the peak. The elevation gain here continued at a somewhat similar pace to the first part of the hike — nothing too crazy but just consistently upwards. As we started getting a little further up, we started hitting the occasional snow field, but none of these really impeded our progress.\n  There were a few snow fields, but they were few and far between here on the north face. Once we had gotten to the final ridgeline up to the Piz Chavalatsch, we were greeted by an absolutely incredible view across the alps to the south. The peak of the Ortler was particularly impressive with its impenetrable glacier leading down from the summer. Also interesting that we could see the groomed summer skiing slopes near the Stelvio pass.\n  A view once reaching the ridgeline. The glacier-covered peak in the center is the Ortler (Italy). The final ascent up to the Piz Chavalatsch was again generally unproblematic. This final part of the ridgeline was perhaps a little steeper than the previous sections, but was generally not exposed. Since this ridge was also south-facing, it was (almost) completely free of snow.\n  The final scent up the ridge to the Piz Chavalatsch. Once at the top, we were met with an insane 360 degree panorama over the surrounding region. There\u0026rsquo;s a small hut at the top which had a couple of benches that we could relax and have a picnic at. All things considered, it was fairly empty at the summit with only around 4 or 5 other people also hanging around taking pictures and enjoying the awesome weather.\nThe southern ridge leading down towards Italy. These brave souls were carrying their bikes up through the snow.  The eastern ridge along the Swiss-Italian border. This is the ridge we would head down next.   Descent and Ridge Crossing to the Rifairscharte # After a quick lunch, we headed down across the ridge on the north side of the Piz Chavalatsch into the Stelvio National Park. Since the ridge is on the north side of the peak, we had to make our way through a few knee-deep snow patches shortly after departing from the peak.\n  The snow was quite a bit deeper on this side of the mountain. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much in the way of elevation changes across the ridge which made this part of the hike a welcome change from the steady ascent up to the top of the Piz Chavalatsch. We had an incredible view into Switzerland in the west and Italy in the east.\n  The view down towards Mals (Italy). We traversed across the ridge until we reached a junction at the Rifairscharte; here we headed west back towards the Swiss side.\n  A view of the north face of the Piz Chavalatsch. The portion from the Rifairscharte down to the forest was the first part of the hike which wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly well marked. We mostly had to rely on our GPS since the trail markers were few and far between.\n  Heading back down towards Sta. Maria. Return Through the Forest # I\u0026rsquo;m normally not particularly fond of hiking through the forest while I\u0026rsquo;m in the mountains; the views are usually not nearly as impressive as when hiking above the treeline. This was a clear exception here though — the hike amongst the larches was truly a treat.\n  Reaching the treeline. We were also lucky to have lighting conditions comparable to golden hour while making our way through the forest despite it only being late afternoon by this point. The light was just peeking through the trees and was causing some really dramatic shadows between the trees and yellow grasses.\n  The late afternoon sun peaking through the forest on our way back to the car. After a beautiful hike through the forest, we had arrived at part of the trail that we took on our way up to the Piz Chavalatsch. After making our way back through the forest and back to the car, we enjoyed a well deserved rest back at the hotel after the very short drive back to Sta. Maria. A fairly long but very worthwhile tour.\n  .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                                           "}).add({id:6,href:"/docs/hiking/chamerstock/",title:"Chamerstock",description:"Above a sea of clouds hiking from the Klausenpass to the Chamerstock.",content:"    Difficulty T3     ⇄ Distance 16.3 km   ↑ Up 750 m   ↓ Down 700 m   Notable Locations Klausenpass, Clariden Glacier, Fisetengrat, Chamerstock, Urnerboden   Public Transit Access?

The weather forecast was absolutely spot-on: the clouds were just under the elevation of the pass. The sea of clouds looked solid enough to walk on.\n  A quick stop on the drive up the Klausenpass looking towards Altdorf. You may have noticed that we\u0026rsquo;ve listed this hike as not being reachable by public transit. While it technically possible to get to the top of the pass via the PostAuto, you would end up starting so late in the morning that it probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be feasible to get all the way to the Chamerstock and then back down to Urnerboden in time to get a PostAuto back to civilization.\n  The top of the Klausenpass looking towards Urnerboden. We're going to be headed along the right-hand side of the valley for this hike. Clariden Glacier # The first main waypoint for this hike is the Clariden Glacier (or at least what\u0026rsquo;s left of it). The hike from the parking lot at the top of the pass is fairly unproblematic — not super steep and very well marked. We were lucky that the ground was frozen as it would have likely been quite muddy had it been above the freezing mark. Once we got a little closer to the glacial lake, there was a little more snow on the ground which made for some nice photos while not being obtrusive to walk through.\n  Approaching the glacial lake that is close to the Clariden Glacier. The lake is in the gully on the other side of the moraine. The route down to the lake is fairly rocky in contrast to the first part of the hike since the lake is located in a gully that\u0026rsquo;s flanked by glacial moraines (essentially big piles of rock that the glacier burped out as it receded). There\u0026rsquo;s a handy aluminum bridge that would likely be pretty important for the warmer months where there\u0026rsquo;s more glacial runoff. With that being said, the water level in the lake was low enough that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessary for us to use.\n  The aluminum bridge near the glacial lake. You can see what's left of the Clariden Glacier in the background. While it isn\u0026rsquo;t absolutely necessary to go down to the lake (we could instead have just followed the path further along the moraine and bypassed the lake all-together), it\u0026rsquo;s a really photogenic spot.\n  The view from the edge of the lake at the base of the Clariden Glacier. Gemsfairen #   The sun finally peeking through over the peak of the mountains. The next portion of the hike goes along the upper portion of the valley; this area is called Gemsfairen. One of the great things with this part of the hike is that you have an uninterrupted view of the mountains down the valley.\n  The view down the valley going down the Gemsfairen. After descending a ways from the glacial lake, you\u0026rsquo;ll get to a small collection of buildings called Gemsfairenhüttli. Make sure to continue along the regular hiking path and not the gravel road. While they both bring you to the same place, the path along the hiking path brings you somewhat higher up the side of the valley and helps you to maintain a good view down the valley.\nThe last bit along the Gemsfairen has a small section that is secured with chains as it is a little bit exposed. This spot is unproblematic though — the rock here is good and the chain offers a nice handhold.\n  Looking back on the path we'd taken down the Gemsfairen. This final section of the Gemsfairen is the only spot on the hike that is secured by chains. Fisetenpass and the Fisetengrat # Not long after the bit with the chains towards the end of the Gemsfairen, we arrived at the Fisetenpass. Up until this spot, the hike had been pretty much devoid of human life — we had the trails entirely to ourselves. Things got somewhat busy once we got to the Fisetenpass though as this is the terminus of the cable car that goes up from Urnerboden. Definitely not the end of the world, but I could see this being very busy during high season in July or August.\n  A view from the Fisetengrat looking back towards the Fisetenpass. The roof of the small building in the foreground is the terminus of the cable car that comes up from Urnerboden. Next, we continued over the Fisetengrat heading towards the Chamerstock. From a scenic point of view, this was definitely the most impressive part of the hike. You have an absolutely incredible 360 degree view from up on this ridge. I certainly understand why they built a cable car to get viewers up here more easily — it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely spectacular up there.\n  The trail along the Fisetengrat.   Another view from the Fisetengrat looking towards the Kalktrittli (cable car station from the hike at the Muttseehütte SAC). Chamerstock and Return to Urnerboden # The peak at the end of the Fisetengrat is the Chamerstock. While definitely a worthwhile destination, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much for us to see at the Chamerstock compared to the hike along the Fisetengrat since the city of Linthal was completely swallowed by the clouds. That\u0026rsquo;s fine though — the sea of clouds below us had gotten quite thick by this point and really made the landscape look like something out of a postcard.\n  A view from the Chamerstock looking back over the Fisetengrat. The snow-covered peak on the left-hand side is the Gemsfairenstock.   The view from the Chamerstock looking towards the village of Tierfed. The clouds had really thickened again. We didn\u0026rsquo;t spend much time at the Chamerstock since we wanted to get back to the cable car with plenty of time to make the (one and only) PostAuto ride back up from Urnerboden to the top of the Klausenpass. Even though we had to re-trace our steps for this part of the hike across the Fisetengrat, it was like doing an entirely new part of the hike since we now had a view up the valley back towards the Klausenpass and the Gemsfairenstock.\n  Another view towards the Piz Russein (left) and the Gemsfairenstock (right). We got extremely lucky at this point: right as we were about to return to the Fisetenpass, the clouds (which had risen in elevation by this point) began spilling over the ridge. The visibility along the ridgeline was very low — not at all dangerous, but just unfortunate for anyone wanting to snap some more pictures. Luckily the cable car is just a stone\u0026rsquo;s throw from the Fisetenpass so this wasn\u0026rsquo;t at all an issue for us.\n  The last part of the traverse back towards the cable car station. The Fisetenpass is hidden here in the clouds. We took the cable car down to Urnerboden and hung around there for the PostAuto. Be careful to make sure that you don\u0026rsquo;t miss this bus because there is only one bus per day that goes from Urnerboden to the Klausenpass. If you have time, I\u0026rsquo;d definitely check out the Alpkäserei Urnerboden, which is just across the street from the PostAuto stop. They have some absolutely delicious locally produced cheese here — would highly recommend.\nThe PostAuto ride up to the top of the Klausenpass was not particularly eventful. Again just make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t miss the bus or you\u0026rsquo;ll be hitchhiking your way up to the top of the pass!\n  .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                                                    "}).add({id:7,href:"/docs/hiking/guferjoch/",title:"Guferjoch",description:"Autumn hike around the Sustenpass.",content:"    Difficulty T4+     ⇄ Distance 11.9 km   ↑ Up 1180 m   ↓ Down 1180 m   Notable Locations Sustlihütte SAC, Guferjoch, Sustenlochfirn, Sustenpass   Public Transit Access?

We could have alternatively taken the PostAuto to the stop Meien, Sustenbrüggli, although we decided to taking the car instead since this is a fairly lengthy hike and we wanted to get started early in the morning.\nAlternatively, we could have arrived the evening before and stayed at the Sustlihütte SAC to get an early start the next morning.\n  The view from the parking lot. The autumn colours at this time of year are truly beautiful. Sustlihütte SAC (Leiterweg) # The first part of this hike had two possible routes: the Normalweg (normal path) or the Leiterweg (ladder path). The ladder path involved 4 ladders and was quite a good warmup for some of the trickier passages later on in the hike. The spots with the ladders were very well secured and were not particularly exposed. With that being said, two of the ladders were somewhat high, so being comfortable with heights was definitely important.\nLadders along the Leiterweg.  Looking towards the Sustenpass.   At the end of the Leiterweg we reached the first waypoint of the day: the Sustlihütte SAC. We didn\u0026rsquo;t stick around here for long since the ascent up from the parking lot wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly long and we wanted to keep moving.\nAlthough the Leiterweg had been marked as a regular hiking path (white-red-white markings), the path as we continued on from the Sustlihütte SAC changed over to an alpine path (white-blue-white markings).\n  A view back to the Sustlihütte SAC which was still in the shadows of the morning sun. Traverse Across the Stöss # The hike from the Sustlihütte SAC to the base of the Guferjoch was a ton of fun. Beautiful views, fun terrain, not a soul around\u0026hellip; Just an all around great trail. There were one or two slightly exposed spots along the traverse along the Stöss, but the path overall was fairly well marked.\n  About half way between the Sustlihütte SAC and the Guferjoch. The Guferjoch is one of the chimneys on the right-hand side of the image. The dramatic shadows down the valley were truly incredible.\n  Looking down the valley towards Wassen. Ascent to the Guferjoch # As is the case with many mountain paths, the exact path along the Stöss to the Guferjoch is not very apparent from the vantage point of the Sustlihütte. Here\u0026rsquo;s the approximate path to reach the Guferjoch:\n  The approximate path leading to the Guferjoch. While most of the path so far had been in the realm of T3, the ascent to the Guferjoch seems to typically be rated at around a T4+. There were a number of fairly sketchy scrambling passages which are largely secured by chains and steel cables. The approximate route up the rock-face to the joch can be seen here:\n  The ascent to the Guferjoch. The first portion of the scramble was secured by a single long steel wire. This wire made the first part of the ascent considerably easier since good handholds were somewhat tricky to find in places due to the rocks having been smoothed considerably from glacial erosion.\n  The first portion of the ascent which is secured by a single (long) steel wire. Following this first scramble, we traversed to the right-hand side of the rock-face, which was secured by a number of chains.\n  The second portion of the ascent which requires a traverse to the right-hand side of the rock-face.   The terrain here is quite exposed; the chains/cables were key for this portion of the ascent. The third and final traverse moved back to the left-hand side of the face, back towards the joch. This was by far the most challenging part of the ascent due to there being several small near-vertical scrambling sections.\nOnce at the top, we were greeted with an incredible view over both sides of the valley — the sweat it took to get up here was definitely worth it!\n  The Guferjoch.   The view towards the Sustenpass with the Sustenhorn to the left of the Steigletscher. Descent to the Sustenlochfirn # The descent from the Guferjoch to the Sustenlochfirn was somewhat similar to the ascent to the Guferjoch with most of the route being secured by chains. There are again a few near-vertical sections that were quite tricky to traverse here. The approximate route can be seen below:\n  The descent from the Guferjoch to the Sustenlochfirn. Note that the upper part of the descent (part indicated with a dashed line) is not visible from this perspective. Something that became apparent to us when we got down to the Sustenlochfirn was that there are two paths we could have taken across the firn. The first (older) path went part way across the firn, over the rock, and then back onto the firn. However, two hikers that we met on our way down from the joch suggested to us that we follow the (new) path, which leads all the way across the firn.\n  The ''new'' path going across the Sustenlochfirn. Sustenpass # The hike back to the Sustenpass was considerably more relaxed than the ascent/descent to the Guferjoch. There were quite a few snowfields that needed crossing, but none of them were exposed.\n  There are several additional snowfields that need crossing on the way back to the Sustenpass. The path was generally well marked, both on the path and when crossing the snowfields. Note that some of the portions across some of the snowfields were marked by Steimännli (deliberately placed piles of rocks) as opposed to white-blue-white markings.\n  Gorgeous views all the way back to the Sustenpass.   Been there, done that ;) Return via 19th Century Pass Road # Once we got to the Sustenpass, we walked along the old 19th century pass road to get back to Sustenbrüggli. This was a nice chill way to end an otherwise (fairly) strenuous hike. It\u0026rsquo;s also very impressive to see the engineering they already had back in the day.\n  Taking the old pass road to return to Sustenbrüggli.   .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                                                                               "}).add({id:8,href:"/docs/hiking/schwalmis/",title:"Schwalmis",description:"Autumn hike in the Isenthal (UR) with views atop the Schwalmis and the Risetenstock.",content:"    Difficulty T3+     ⇄ Distance 11.8 km   ↑ Up 880 m   ↓ Down 880 m   Notable Locations Schwalmis, Risetenstock   Public Transit Access?

The cable car station can be reached via public transit by taking a PostAuto from Altdorf to Isenthal, Seilbahn St. Jakob. We decided to go by car instead though; there is quite a bit of parking space at the cable car station.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a landline telephone in the cable car station that we had to use to request for the cable car to run — it\u0026rsquo;s a little old-school, but it gets the job done. We payed for the cable car ride once we got to the top.\n  Cable car from St. Jakob to Gitschenen. Schwalmis # The first portion of the hike from the cable car in Gitschenen to the marsh plain at Ober Bolgen was fairly straight forward. There was a fork in the path about half way across the plain, which was the start of the ascent to the Schwalmis. This bit was moderately steep but it was not particularly exposed.\nMarsh plain.  Risetenstock.   After about 150 m of elevation gain, we\u0026rsquo;d reached the ridge which led to the Schwalmis. This was the first part of the hike where we needed to be very careful with our foot placement; slipping here would have be less than ideal.\n  The ridge leading up to the Schwalmis. We didn\u0026rsquo;t stay at the top for long — it was quite windy and a cloud swept in right as we got to the top. We still had a nice view over the valley in one direction, but only a wall of fog in the other.\n  From the top of the Schwalmis. Risetenstock # The next peak of the day was the Risetenstock. We had to back-track part of the way from the Schwalmis to get back to the path we were on near the marsh plain.\n  View back from the ridge leading to the Schwalmis. The Risetenstock is the one on the left. Once we got back to the path near the marsh plain, there were two parallel paths that led to the Hinter Jochli. We decided to take the one that was slightly further down into the valley since it seemed considerably less vulnerable to rockfalls.\n  Cloud cover as seen from the Hinter Jochli. The last bit up to the Risetenstock was, again, pretty unproblematic. The path itself was a little bit steep, but was otherwise not exposed. We stopped for a quick lunch break at the top.\n  Our lunch spot at the top of the Risetenstock; we had the peak entirely to ourselves. Glattgrat # The Glattgrat (which in German literally means \u0026ldquo;smooth ridge\u0026rdquo;) was definitely the funnest portion of the hike. Hiking directly on the ridge meant that the change in elevation was fairly minimal and the views were pretty incredible all the way. It would have been nice being able to see down into the Isenthal, but having the clouds pushing their way right over the ridge while still having a clear view on the other side of the ridge was pretty mystical.\n  The view from the top of the Risetenstock looking towards the Glattgrat (here on the left in the clouds). Something that became apparent pretty quickly was where the Glattgrat gets its name from — there were quite a few spots with fairly smooth rock sections. While not normally problematic, we had to be mindful of our footing since all of the rocks were wet from the fog.\n  Looking back onto part of the Glattgrat we'd already traversed. Steinalper Jochli and Geissboden # While we hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen almost anyone on the path so far, we encountered quite a number of small groups once we got to the Schuenegg. Most of these people seem to have come up from the Brisenhaus SAC hut and had the intention to go to the lookout point on the Brisen.\n  From the end of the Glattgrat at the Schuenegg. The path we took continued towards the Brisen (peak in the center of the frame) and can be seen on the right-hand side of the image. The brief traverse from the Schuenegg to the Steinalper Jochi was by far the most exposed part of the hike. The path is quite narrow and follows one of the natural rock-bands on the mountain face. I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn the approximate path in below:\n  The traverse from the Schuenegg (right) to the Steinalper Jochi (left). The hike from here down the valley towards Geissboden was pretty chill. We came across a herd of sheep that were being protected by a few Great Pyrenees mountain dogs, so we made sure to steer clear of them on our descent.\n  View down the valley towards Geissboden. From Geissboden we followed a gravel road back to Gitschenen. We took the same cable car back down to return to where we\u0026rsquo;d parked our car.\n  The final portion of the hike back to Gitschenen.   .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                                        "}).add({id:9,href:"/docs/hiking/glecksteinhuette_sac/",title:"Glecksteinhütte SAC",description:"Difficulty T3+     ⇄ Distance 9.2 km   ↑ Up 910 m   ↓ Down 910 m   Notable Locations Glecksteinhütte SAC, Grindelwald   Public Transit Access?

Yes1        Overview Map Detailed Description Gallery   Quick Summary #  A beautiful but very exposed hike to the Glecksteinhütte SAC near Grindelwald. Starting point was easily accessible with public transit.  Took the bus from Meiringen to Schwarzwaldalp and then took a connecting bus from Schwarzwaldalp to Grindelwald, Abzw. Gleckstein. On the way back, I opted to take the bus from Grindelwald, Abzw. Gleckstein down to Grindelwald and then returned with the train from there.   Most of the path was very narrow and extremely exposed.  Warning signs at the start of the trail advised against traversing this path when the conditions are poor. A significant portion of the trail was secured with chains to provide more secure handholds.   There was only a single path which led up the valley, so I took the same path on both the ascent and descent. It would have been possible to stay overnight at the Glecksteinhütte, but I opted to do this tour in a single day instead.     Download GPX   Ascent to the Main Valley #   The view from the bus stop Grindelwald, Abzw. Gleckstein. The peak on the right-hand-side is the famous Eiger. The red arrows indicate part of the path to the Glecksteinhütte.   Today's destination.   The sign roughly translates to: ''Mountain path with very steep drop-offs. Only suitable for hikers with suitable equipment who are comfortable with heights and are surefooted. Particularly dangerous during heavy precipitation and storms.''   Most of the hike consisted of this kind of terrain: fairly narrow paths that had been blasted out of the rock. According to the topography maps, the drop-off here is about 200m to 300m.   As can be seen on the left-hand-side, there were steel wires/chains that were mounted along the length of the path to provide better handholds. Ascent to the Glecksteinhütte #   The sun just starting to peek down the valley.   The first view down the primary (unnamed) valley that leads to the Glecksteinhütte.   Some gravel trails to switch it up from the smooth rock portions from earlier.   ...And back to the smooth high-quality rock.   This was probably one of the sketchiest spots from the hike. This stream passed over the path, which made the rock very slippery here. Luckily, it was secured by both the steel wire on the left as well as some rubber mats for traction.   I was really impressed by how well this path is maintained.   A view back down the valley.   The Oberer Grindelwaldgletscher spilling down at the end of the valley.   Today's objective is finally in sight :)   Some Edelweiss to make things even more picturesque.   Time for some lunch!      Yes, that is indeed a chicken. (And no, this was not my lunch.)   The view from my lunch spot. Descent Back to Abzw. Gleckstein #   As mentioned, I took the same path back down to the PostAuto stop.   Despite being the same path I took on the ascent, the perspective was completely different which made it feel like a completely new route.   Nearly at the end of the primary valley.   I was very thankful on the way down for all of the steel handholds.   Finally back at the PostAuto stop with a gorgeous view over the village of Grindelwald.   .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                                                                                          When I did this hike, the buses from Schwarzwaldalp to Grindelwald, Abzw.

It was extremely foggy for most of the way up to the Sidelhorn. It was only once we got further up that we were able to peek above the clouds. Luckily the path is very well marked. A view of the path we'd taken up to the ridge line. After not having a viewing distance of more than about 10 m for most of the hike, we were finally rewarded with our first glimpses of blue skies once we got further up the ridge line. Shortly before reaching the final (fairly steep) ascent to the summit, the clouds cleared up seemingly out of nowhere. Truly a spectacular view down the valley towards the Oberaarhorn (still shrouded in the clouds in this picture). Sidelhorn # The last bit to the top of the Sidelhorn was quite steep but generally not exposed. Despite it being August, it was very cold up here. Quite a bit of the path close to the summit was ice covered, which made an otherwise (relatively) easy ascent become a little sketchy. A view from the summit of the Sidelhorn; we had the top of the mountain entirely to ourselves. View towards the Nufenenpass (up the valley but not visible here). A small window in the clouds let us have a brief view of the Furkapass (road on the right side of the image). Descent to the Triebteseewli # The descent along the western ridge line towards the Triebtesee-Licken required a little bit of scrambling at times, but was not exposed. The main hindrance we had to watch out for (similar to the ascent) were the sneaky patches of ice on some of the rocks. A view up the valley after descending from the Triebtesee-Licken. The lake in the foreground is the Trieteseewli. Return via the Husegghütte # We returned to the Grimselpass via a path that was below (but parallel to) the path we took up to the Sidelhorn. Despite being a little icy on the way up, we didn't really hit much in the way of snow apart from a few patches (like this one) that had accumulated in some of the gullies. This was something we're always careful about regardless of where we're hiking in Switzerland, but especially if there are signs warning us about it. Luckily we didn't find any UXOs on our hike.

Most people seemed to hike up along the river on the north side so we had the trail mostly to ourselves if you hike up on the southern side As the thick green foliage suggests, this valley is quite temperate. We decided to go early in the morning because it can get extremely hot here later in the day during the summer months We thoroughly enjoyed making a stop at the Obersee near the Kröntenhütte     Download GPX   Ascent to the Kröntenhütte SAC #   The first part of the ascent up to the Kröntenhütte SAC. This picture is taken from the south-side of the valley looking east towards Erstfeld.   Despite the foliage being extremely thick, there are frequent clearings that gave us a nice panorama of the valley.   Once we started getting a little higher up, the trees began to clear and we had more consistent views of the surrounding mountains. Kröntenhütte and the Obersee #   A first view of the Kröntenhütte. The Krönten is one of the peaks which is just out of view on the right-hand-side of the image. The fuorcla (saddle) on the left side of the image is the Steinchälenfurggli which has an alpine path (marked white-blue-white) that goes over to the next valley to the Leutschahhütte SAC.   At the hut itself.   The Obersee is about a 10-15 minute walk from the Kröntenhütte. Here we're looking west towards the Oberseemänndli.   Lots of sheep hanging out at the Obersee. Return Along the Alpbach #   Returning back towards the Kröntenhütte, we continued down towards the Fulensee. Here we are looking back towards the waterfalls which are coming down from the Obersee.   Another view of the waterfalls coming down from the Obersee. Here we can see the Kröntenhütte to the left of the falls.   The only (slightly) exposed part of the hike. This short passage is immediately after the Fulensee and took us down to the Alpbach river. While the path here is quite wide and most of the descent is secured by chains, I could imagine this being a little more sketchy when wet.   A view down the Erstfeldertal. The Alpbach is in the gully just to the left side of the image.   Some of the rather turbulent falls along the Alpbach. Despite being named a ''bach'' (which in German means stream or creek), I think describing it as a river is a little more fitting.   Once again getting back below the tree line.

From the Julierpass, there was only a single path that lead southwards towards the lake Leg Grevasalvas. After the lake, there was again only a single path that lead further down the valley towards the Fuorcla Grevasalvas. Stopped for a quick lunch break at the top of the Fuorcla. Descended down the other side of the Fuorcla and then headed towards the village of Grevasalvas. From Grevasalvas down to the Plaun da Lej consisted of gravel roads.

While the hike itself isn\u0026rsquo;t very dangerous, most of the hike is on smooth rocks which can make the path quite slippery when wet.     Download GPX   Ascent to the Bächlital #   The dam at the end of the Räterichsbodensee. There is both a parking lot as well as the PostAuto stop right beside this dam. The path that leads to the Bächlitalhütte more or less goes straight up the side of the valley at the end of the dam.   A view back down to the Räterichsbodensee. The alproses are still in full bloom.   The clouds are a little unpredictable today. Regardless though, the intermittent periods of clear skies offer some great views down the valley.   This gives a fairly good idea of what most of the path up to the Bächlisboden glacial runoff plain looks like. Most of the path is quite narrow and largely consists of these sorts of stone steps.   A final view of the valley which leads up to the Grimsel Pass. The Räterichsbodensee is hiding beneath the clouds. Along the Bächlital #   Turning 180\u0026#176; from where the previous picture was taken, we now have our first view into the Bächlital. Luckily, the clouds are still fairly low and haven't yet made their way into this side valley as a result.   Making our way up the first part of the Bächlital. The path here is a lot less steep compared to the first part of the hike.   The path is very well marked and is generally unproblematic.   Our first view of the Bächlisboden glacial flood plain as well as the Bächlitalhütte SAC (perched up on the right-hand-side of the valley at the end of the plain). The majority of the path leading to the hut hugs the right side of the valley.   Making our way along the right-hand side of the valley towards the Bächlitalhütte. This is the first part of the hike that wasn't quite as clearly marked as the rest. With that being said, there's only really one way you can go so it's not a big problem.   Only one more short ascent to go until we've reached the hut.   A quick look back down from where we've come from. The clouds are now slowly starting to creep into the Bächlital.   This portion of the path is again very well marked. Similar to the first portion of the hike, the path consists mostly of stacked rocks (almost like stair steps) which makes the ascent pretty enjoyable.   Looks kind of mysterious with those clouds...    Venturing Beyond the Hut #   After a relaxing coffee on the patio, we decided to make our way further up the Bächlital a little. We didn't really have a clear goal in mind, but we were curious if we'd get a break in the clouds further up the valley.   A really beautiful path.   The Bächligletscher at the end of the valley. We have it to thank for this absolutely spectacular valley.   You often find moss campion in these rocky terrains where you wouldn't imaging anything would be capable of growing. Nature is truly amazing.   After not having any luck with the clearing cloud cover, we decided to make our way back to the hut and return back to the Räterichsbodensee. A Foggy Return #   The view from the patio of the Bächlitalhütte is really pretty spectacular. These sorts of braided river systems are typical to find in the mountains close to the melt of a glacier.   And now back at the plain, back in rolls the fog. At least we were lucky enough to have an incredible view over the valley from our vantage point at the hut.   This was the majority of the view for the way down. Not much to see, but still an enjoyable descent. As mentioned before though, watch out for moss covered rocks on the way down as some of them were quite slippery due to the fog (Bruno wiped out once on a large flat mossy rock on the descent).   Back at the Räterichsbodensee. It's a bit of a shame that the weather didn't want to cooperate for the latter part of the day, but overall the hike was an absolute blast. This is definitely one we'll have to do again once in the future on a clearer day.   .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                                                                               "}).add({id:14,href:"/docs/hiking/muttseehuette_sac/",title:"Muttseehütte SAC",description:"Difficulty T3     ⇄ Distance 11.2 km   ↑ Up 730 m   ↓ Down 730 m   Notable Locations Tierfed, Kalktrittli, Muttseehütte SAC, Muttenchopf, Limmerensee   Public Transit Access?

From Kalktrittli we took the newly constructed path which had been blown out of the side of the mountain.  While the path is quite wide and very well maintained, it is extremely exposed (near-vertical drop of around 800 m).   Hiked up towards the Muttenwändli via the Nüschentäli.  We had a few small snowfields to cross despite it being mid-summer.   Coffee and Wähe at the Muttseehütte SAC. Quick pit-stop on the Muttenchopf. Descent to the Limmerensee. Return via the access tunnel used for constructing the dams at the Limmerensee and the Muttsee.     Download GPX   Kalktrittli #   Taking the cable car up from Tierfed to Kalktrittli. This cable car was initially built for when they were constructing the expansion to the dam at the Muttsee. This cable car was built to transport vehicles and huge amounts of materials to the construction site and not a couple tourists looking for an epic hiking trail ;)   There are only two official paths that lead to the Muttseehütte. The first one (left arrow; this is the one we'll be taking here) goes up along a newly constructed path to the Nüschentäli while the second goes through an access tunnel that leads directly though the mountain. We'll be taking the access tunnel on the way back.   Inside the very industrial looking ''Bergstation'' for the cable car. Literally looks like we're hanging out in the secret hideout for a James Bond villain. You can tell this place wasn't initially built with tourism in mind.   The slightly ominous looking door leading to the cable car. Nüschentäli to the Muttseehütte #   The Kalktrittli cable car station. This newly constructed path is pretty wide but has a very steep drop off; this photo doesn't do the exposure justice.   The view forwards towards the Limmerentobel (valley where the sunlight is coming in from). According to the topography map, it would be around an 800 m drop if we were to fall here. We definitely had to watch our step.   There were a few very short passages like this which were secured by chains. They definitely wouldn't have been necessary, but it helped to make the ascent a little more relaxed.   Looking from the Vorder Nüschenegg towards the Selbsanft. By this point, most of the exposed sections are behind us.   A view from the Nüschentäli looking west towards the Clariden (one of the peaks near the expansive glacier).   A few snowfields still hanging around despite it being mid-summer. Nothing too problematic though.   It always seems like magic to me that moss campion is able to thrive in these extremely rocky areas where seemingly nothing else wants to grow. Truly beautiful.   Our first view of the Limmerensee. The grassy plateau on the left is the Muttenchopf. We're going to make a stop there after we stop for a coffee at the Muttseehütte.   The Muttsee. Most of the tunnel infrastructure we'll be seeing later was built for an expansion project for this hydroelectric dam. The Muttseehütte (not visible here) is just out of frame on the right-hand-side.   At the Muttseehütte SAC.   Refueling with some delicious Wähe and coffee. Muttenchopf and the Limmerensee #   After we'd finished our coffee, we continued on towards the Muttenchopf. Here we're looking back towards the Muttseehütte.   This glacial valley is absolutely incredible. It's uncommon to find these sorts of fjord-like valleys in Switzerland. The Muttenchopf is the plateau on the right side.   The view down to the Limmerensee from the Muttenchopf.   This is the kind of place I imagine Swiss geology students go to for fieldwork. Apart from all of the well defined folds, the offset layer to the left of the snow covered gully might be the most spectacular textbook example of a reverse fault I have ever seen.   Making our way down towards the Limmerensee. We were really impressed with how well the hiking path is maintained here (even for Swiss standards).   Another view down towards the Limmerensee.   Plenty of alproses to add some colour to the somewhat rocky terrain.   This place is so peaceful. We had the trail almost entirely to ourselves.   A short scrambling passage secured by chains. It's not at all exposed though.   Finally down at the Limmerensee. This is the first part of the hike where we saw quite a number of people. There was a school class here for a field trip, but they had only taken the cable car up and walked through the access tunnel to get here (hence, not taking the hiking trail). That approach would likely make for a good family outing on a weekend. Return Through the Access Tunnel # NOTE: We were REQUIRED to wear a safety vest through the tunnel. There was a box with a bunch of them at the door leading into the tunnel; we took one from this bin and then deposited it back in the box at the other end of the tunnel.\n  Pretty neat that they make this accessible to the public. It is also quite a nice shortcut without which this hike would likely not have been doable in a day.   There are some pretty neat little side tunnels we explored here as well. This particular one lets you go onto the dam at the end of the Limmerensee.   It really is pretty incredible what's possible to build using the state of the art in engineering.   The relatively long return back to the cable car. This tunnel leads directly back to the ''James Bond villain lair'' where we got the cable car back down to Tierfed.   .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                                                                               "}).add({id:15,href:"/docs/hiking/siwfass/",title:"Siwfass",description:"Difficulty T2     ⇄ Distance 8.3 km   ↑ Up 490 m   ↓ Down 490 m   Notable Locations Riemenstalden, Gitschen, Spilauersee, Siwfass   Public Transit Access?

There is a phone at the bottom of the cable car that you need to use to call up to the hut at the top; they will run the cable car then. Cost was around 20.- per person and they only accepted cash (although I think they may also accept Twint now?).   From Gitschen, we hiked to the Spilauersee. The ascent to the Siwfass from the Spilauersee involved first hiking up to the joch between the Hagelstock and the Siwfass and then taking an unofficial path from the joch up to the Siwfass.  While not being an official hiking path, the dirt path was very visible and easy to follow. There was a single bench at the top of the Siwfass which offered a great view of the surrounding peaks.   Descended the Siwfass to the west and circled around the Hundstock to get back to Gitschen. Took the cable car back down to Käppeliberg.   Coming soon\u0026hellip; #  Spilauersee #   The cable car which goes from Käppeliberg to Gitschen. There is only room for 4 or 5 people inside.   A view back to Gitschen. One of these huts is where the cable car station is.   Starting to make our way towards the Spilauersee. This area is a beloved spot in the winter for backcountry skiing and snowshoeing because of its relative proximity to Lucerne and Zug while still being relatively high up. The Rossstock (peak on the very left of the image) is one of the most popular of these winter tours.   ''Tour guide'' Bruno pointing out where the backcountry skiing routes are in the winter.   A small hut located just above the Spilauersee (visible on the right-hand-side of the image). Siwfass #   Looking back from the joch between the Hagelstock and the Siwfass. The peak on the left-hand-side is the Rossstock. There's still a surprising amount of snow up here despite being mid-summer.   The view southward towards the Hoch Fulen (large peak in the center) from the plateau just below the Siwfass.   The Hundstock (literally means ''dog stick'') as seen from the ascent to the Siwfass.   A view westward towards the Diepen. After we descend from the Siwfass, we'll be making our way from left to right across this flat plain.   At the top of the Siwfass. A nice little spot to enjoy a bite to eat. Return to Gitschen #   After making our way down from the Siwfass, we headed westward toward the Schön Chulm. This is a view towards the Siwfass (peak in the center). The path to the top first leads below the near-vertical rock face and then doubles back over the ridge to the top.   There were a ton of wildflowers down near the Schön Chulm. This is the view southward towards the Gotthard.   Incredible colours here. Here looking towards the Urnersee (south-eastern part of the Vierwaldstättersee).   A waypoint slightly to the north of Schön Chulm.   Continuing north between the Tibistock and the Hundstock, here we are looking back towards the Siwfass (peak on the right).   Gradually approaching the treeline again. The ridge behind Bruno on the other side of the valley is the Chlingenstock (Stoos).   On the north side of the Hundstock we started running into some very curious cows. Apart from a single photographer we met near the Spilauersee, these cows were the only other living things we saw the whole hike.   Once again back at Gitschen. The cable car is just beside the barn on the bottom left part of the image.   .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                                             There is a small PostAuto that goes to Riemenstalden from Sisikon, but it requires a seat reservation and drives very infrequently.

Download GPX   Ascent to the Schimbrig #   The view from the parking lot. The white cross on the left-hand side of the ridge at the top of the mountain is the Schimbrig and the peak to the right of the rocky precipice on the right is the Hängst.   Most of the ascent consisted of these kinds of hiking paths (blue-white-blue markings). Most of the lower parts are fairly well marked, but some of the sections higher up required a little more attention to make sure we stayed on the correct path.   Another view back over the hiking path we'd taken to this point. Again, not terribly exposed here, but the path itself was fairly steep.   Starting the ascent to the ridge that lead to the Hängst. While still not particularly exposed, this part of the ridge was very strenuous because of how steep the path was (some sections had upwards of a 40% incline).   Turning 180° from where the previous picture was taken.   Our first view of the Hängst (peak on the right). Here we opted to follow the official path (left) that leads below the summit of the Hängst. Part of this section involved crossing the snow field which was by far the sketchiest part of the hike.   Looking back towards where the previous picture was taken. This photo was taken directly at the edge of the snow field (behind where I am standing).   We finally made it up to the ridge between the Hängst and the Schimbrig. The path we came up was on the right-hand side where the blue waypoint is pointing. The crux (T4) for the ascent to the Hängst can be seen here on the left; the narrow ridge leading up to the peak has around a 200 m to 300 m drop on both sides. We decided to skip that one for this time.   The beautiful panorama view from the ridge. The summit cross of the Schimbrig can be seen here on the right. There were already quite some people there so we decided to find a spot to sit here on the ridge and not near the cross. (Note: we were pretty much alone on the way up; most of the people at the summit cross took the regular hiking route from the west side of the Schimbrig instead.) Descent back to Gründli #   After a well deserved lunch, we headed back down on the western side of the Schimbrig. The hiking paths for this descent were quite a bit less steep than the alpine trail we took on the way up.   Even though we weren't terribly high up here, there are still pretty consistent views of the surrounding peaks which is always great.   A look back up the path we'd just descended.   A look back up to the Schimbrig.   The last portion of the hike consisted of gravel roads. Definitely a nice way to end an otherwise fairly steep hike.   .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                                     "}).add({id:17,href:"/docs/",title:"Explore",description:"View one of our previous tours.",content:"View one of our previous tours.\n"}).add({id:18,href:"/docs/hiking/leglerhuette_sac/",title:"Leglerhütte SAC",description:"Difficulty T2     ⇄ Distance 11.7 km   ↑ Up 790 m   ↓ Down 790 m   Notable Locations Kies Cable Car, Stausee Garichti, Chärpfbrugg, Leglerhütte SAC, Ratzmatt   Public Transit Access?

At the Chammseeli looking again towards the Glärnisch massif.   There were a few of these surprisingly large marshes somewhat below the Chammseeli. The hiking path leads around the lake, so keeping our feet dry wasn't an issue here.   Some fairly typical landscapes for this part of the alps. The reddish grasses at this time of year always add some nice contrast into the scenery.   There were a fair few huts on the way down to Ratzmatt.   The view south from near the Matzlenfurggelen. Ratzmatt is the collection of buildings on the right-hand-side in the valley. The previous picture was taken at one of the huts up on the plateau in the center of the image. We didn't take very many pictures from the plateau down to Ratzmatt because the ground was extremely wet and slippery.   .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                            "}).add({id:19,href:"/docs/hiking/nepali_highway/",title:"Nepali Highway",description:"Difficulty T3+     ⇄ Distance 10.8 km   ↑ Up 350 m   ↓ Down 670 m   Notable Locations Furkapass, Sidelenhütte, Nepali Highway, Albert-Heim Hütte SAC, Schafberg, Tiefenbach   Public Transit Access?

Took the Blue-White-Blue marked path known as the \u0026ldquo;Nepali Highway\u0026rdquo; to the base of the Tiefengletscher. After a stop at the lake at the terminus of the Tiefengletscher, we hiked to the Albert-Heim Hütte SAC. Continued to the top of the Schafberg.  Descended down the southern ridge of the Schafberg to Schluechtbiel.   Walked back along the gravel road to the parking lot near Tiefenbach.     Download GPX   Sidelenhütte #   The view northward from the top of the Furkapass.   Our first view of the Sidelenhütte — still a ways to go until we get there though.   Looking back towards the Furkapass.   There are a few of these small lakes along the way up to the Sidelenhütte — typical landscape for these sorts of post-glacial landscapes.   The path leading to the Albert-Heim Hütte is the one we took and is locally known as the Nepali Highway. Nepali Highway #   The start of the Nepali Highway shortly after leaving the Sidelenhütte. This is one of a hand-full of scrambling passages.   Another look back up towards some of the scrambling passages. Most of the trickier passages here are secured with a combination of ropes, steel cables, or rebar steps.   This gives a pretty good impression of what most of the Nepali Highway looks like.   Apparently this is area is very beloved by climbers. I've highlighted a few groups that were making their way up this cliff here.   Looking down towards Tiefenbach. The parking lot we parked at can be seen a stones-throw to the left of the restaurant.   The path thus far was pretty well marked and was overall very enjoyable to traverse.   Shortly before the tarn at the base of the Tiefengletscher became visible, there was another short scrambling passage across some boulders. Some of the boulders were pretty unstable so we had to be somewhat mindful of our hand/footholds. Tiefengletscher and the Albert-Heim Hütte SAC #   Our first view of the Tiefengletscher and the tarn at the base of it.   A view towards the Albert-Heim Hütte; the hut can be seen perched up on one of the rock formations in the center of the image.   The landscape here is absolutely incredible.   Nearly at the Albert-Heim Hütte.   The Albert-Heim Hütte SAC with the Tiefengletscher in the background. We stopped here for a drink and then continued to the Schafberg. Schafberg and Return to Tiefenbach #   Shortly before the top of the Schafberg. The Schafberg is only about a 10-15 minute hike from the Albert-Heim Hütte.   At the top of the Schafberg. We didn't stick around long since we had just taken a break at the Albert-Heim Hütte.   The view down the Hospental towards Rehalp and Andermatt (both not visible here).   Looking towards the Furkapass.   .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                                                                                        "}).add({id:20,href:"/docs/hiking/barrhorn/",title:"Barrhorn",description:'A 3 day hike in the Turtmanntal summiting the highest "hiking" mountain in Switzerland.',content:"    Difficulty T3+     Numer of Days 3   ⇄ Total Distance 24.9 km   ↑ Up 1820 m   ↓ Down 1880 m   Notable Locations Turtmannhütte SAC, Üssers Barrhorn, Schöllijoch, Gruben   Public Transit Access?

A look down the Turtmanntal. Most of the path leading to the Turtmannsee consists of gravel roads.   The gravel road leading up to the Turtmannsee (behind the dam near the end of the valley). The large glacier in the center of the image is the Turtmanngletscher.   At the Turtmannsee. The Turtmannhütte (objective for today) can be seen up on the left-hand side of the valley. Turtmannhütte SAC #   Shortly after we got to the Turtmannsee, the path switched over to a regular hiking path. Much of the ascent to the Turtmannhütte goes over the moraine.   The path up to the Turtmannhütte was very well marked.   Some Edelweiss — not a particularly common sight in the mountains.   At the Turtmannhütte SAC looking back towards the Bishorn. The couloir we had to go up on day 2 is one of the gulleys above the scree slope on the left.   The evening sun from the vantage point of the Turtmannhütte looking down the Turtmanntal.

The crux of the hike (see below) was only about a 30 minute walk from the hut; there was only one officially marked trail that lead to the crux.\n  The crux of the hike. The ascent up this couloir (known as the Gässi) was secured by a metal wire. It is somewhat exposed, so falling here would be less than ideal.   The crux as seen from above.   Once we were above the Gässi, we had an absolutely incredible view of the alpenglow on the surrounding peaks. The prominent peak in the center is the Bishorn.   Looking back towards the Turtmannspitze. Ascent to the Üssers Barrhorn #   A short scrambling passage about 600m below the summit of the Barrhorn (not visible here).   Bruno making his way through the 'Steiwüesti' ('rock desert'). A good chunk of the ascent consisted of this kind of terrain.   Our first proper view of the Üssers Barrhorn (the peak which is furthest to the left). The word 'Üssers' is Swiss German for 'Äußeres', meaning 'outer'.   While most of the hike is relatively well-marked, there are some sections (like here) that are marked with Steimännli instead of with conventional painted trail markers. This spot is about 200m - 300m below the summit.   Almost at the summit. It's such a strange feeling to be higher than a lot of the other surrounding peaks.   The summit cross. What an incredible view.   The view south-west from the summit. Most of the path up to the Üssers Barrhorn goes over the ridge on the edge of the Brunegggletscher (closest glacier relative to us).   One final view from the summit before heading down to the Schöllijoch. The forecast was predicting that the weather would turn sour around noon, so we wanted to make our way down before the snow and rain rolled in. Descent to the Schöllijoch #   Shortly after leaving the summit. The Inners Barrhorn is the left-most peak, with the Brunegghorn and Bishorn to the right of that.   Nearly at the Schöllijoch; this is the saddle where the yellow-orange rocks are concentrated.   The Üssers Barrhorn as seen from just below the Inners Barrhorn.   Almost at the Schöllijoch; if you look closely, you can see the waypoint on the right-hand-side. The Brunegghorn (peak in the center of the image) is already shrouded in the promised clouds. It's about time we get off this mountain.   Looking back towards the Inners Barrhorn (right) and the Üssers Barrhorn (left). The group that is traversing below the Inners Barrhorn was on their way up to the Üssers Barrhorn. However, when we met them later at the Turtmannhütte, they said that it started snowing once they approached the summit. I guess starting early payed off. Return to the Turtmannhütte SAC #   The descent down from the Schöllijoch. Much of the lower part of the trail goes over one of the moraines.   Some very precariously perched rocks above the hiking trail.   The return over the moraine back to the Turtmannhütte. It began raining shortly after this picture was taken.   .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                                                                              Day 3: Return to Gruben #    Difficulty T2     ⇄ Distance 9.7 km   ↑ Up 220 m   ↓ Down 870 m   Notable Locations Turtmannhütte SAC, Ämser Schafalpu, Gruben   Public Transit Access?

The terrain here is in stark contrast to the rocky moraines we were hiking over the day before.   It was raining on-and-off for much of the day. Spirits were high from the previous day though, so we were happy as can be.   There were several passages like this over loose or otherwise dislocated rock.   Lots of clouds around, but luckily not where we were.   The end of the Turtmanntal shrouded in clouds. We would soon begin our descent down to Gruben from here.   An interesting rockfall/avalanche barrier directly above Gruben (the village of Gruben is down to the left; out of view). We thought it was pretty neat that the hiking trail goes over the ridge of this quasi-dam.   Making our way down to the village through the forest. The trees gave us some respite from the wind. While the weather may have been so-so, this was a great way to end an epic trip.   .image-gallery {overflow: auto; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: -5%!important; } .image-gallery li {float: left; display: block; margin: 0 0 1% 1%; width: 19%;} .image-gallery li a {text-align: center; text-decoration: none!important; color: #777;} .image-gallery li a span {display: block; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; padding: 3px 0;} .image-gallery li a img {width: 100%; display: block; border-radius: 7.5px}                            There was indeed an alp taxi that was part of the standard SBB timetable.
