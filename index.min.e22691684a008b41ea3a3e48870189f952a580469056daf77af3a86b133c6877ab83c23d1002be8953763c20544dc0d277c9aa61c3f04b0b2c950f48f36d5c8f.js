One of the main ones that\u0026rsquo;s used in Switzerland for designating the difficulties for hiking trails are the so-called \u0026ldquo;SAC Berg- und Alpinwanderskala\u0026rdquo; which roughly translates to \u0026ldquo;SAC Mountain and Alpine Hiking Scale\u0026rdquo;; this is a scale from T1 (easiest) to T6 (most difficult). Routes listed with a \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; indicate tours which are above an average level of difficulty for that class (so a T4+ is more difficult than a T4, but not quite in T5 territory yet).\nBelow is a rough English translation of what each of these difficulty levels entails.2 For full details, check out the original SAC difficulty designations here.\n   Difficulty Characteristics Requirements     T1 Hike  Well constructed path/roadIf present, exposed sections are very well securedDanger of falling is under normal circumstances very minimal Basic mobilityRunning shoes are suitableNavigation is unproblematic   T2 Mountain Hike  Trail with continuous pathTerrain is partly steepDanger of falls not out of the question Somewhat surefootedTrekking shoes recommendedElementary navigation skills   T3 Difficult Mountain Hike  Path not necessarily continuously visibleExposed areas can be secured with ropes or chainsMay need hands for balanceSome exposed areas with danger of fallsScree plains SurefootedGood trekking shoesAverage orientation skillsElementary alpine experience   T4 Alpine Hike  Potentially pathlessMay need hands to traverse certain passagesTerrain is quite exposed and can contain steep grass slopes, crags, simple firn fields, and snowy glacier passages. Familiar with exposed terrainSturdy trekking shoesStrong terrain assessment and orientation skillsAlpine experienceIf weather changes, it can be difficult to retreat   T5 Difficult Alpine Hike  Often pathlessContain some easy climbing passagesExposed and demanding terrainFirn fields and glacier passages with increased exposure Experience in high alpine terrainMountaineering bootsVery good terrain assessment and orientation skillsBasic knowledge of handling of ice axes and rope   T6 Very Difficult Alpine Hike (Generally not marked) Normally pathlessModerately difficult climbing sectionsOften extremely exposedPrecarious ridge passagesGlacier passages with increased exposure Extensive high alpine experienceExcellent navigation skillsExperienced with various mountaineering tools    These difficulty ratings assume that the tour is performed under optimal conditions. This means things like:\n Good weather Dry terrain Good snow conditions Etc.  A common misconception is that T5 or T6 hikes are less difficult than \u0026ldquo;easy\u0026rdquo; high alpine tours (these use a different difficulty scale). Many T5 or T6 tours have little to no opportunities to secure oneself the way one may be able to on easier high alpine routes which makes it imperative that one has absolute mastery over alpine environments. Typical examples of such terrains include extremely steep grass slopes, unmarked routes along unstable scree slopes, or very exposed ridge traverses. Due to the different attributes which are used to characterize high alpine routes and hiking trails, there is certainly overlap in terms of \u0026ldquo;absolute difficulty\u0026rdquo; between both hiking and high alpine tours.\nSome Useful (Mostly German) Geographic Words to Know # There are a lot of words that you\u0026rsquo;ll likely come across when people list the names of different places in the mountains. Here are a few common terms/prefixes that might be useful to know:\n Canton: The Swiss version of a \u0026ldquo;state\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;province\u0026rdquo;. ＿horn: A type of pyramid shaped mountain; usually with 3 or 4 distinct faces. Formed through glacial erosion on each face, so they\u0026rsquo;re usually at fairly high elevations. Piz ＿: Similar meaning to \u0026ldquo;horn\u0026rdquo;; typically used in the Canton of Graubünden (eastern Switzerland) ＿stock: Another name for a certain peak; are usually (but not always) at lower elevations than horns. ＿spitz: Literally means \u0026ldquo;point\u0026rdquo;; does not really give an indication to how high the mountain is. ＿joch: A saddle or gully between two peaks. ＿pass: Usually a road that connects two valleys. These often serve as connection points to go from one Canton to another. ＿tal: Means \u0026ldquo;valley\u0026rdquo;. ＿gletscher: Means \u0026ldquo;glacier\u0026rdquo;. ＿firn: Snow that stays all-year round without melting but has not yet turned to ice to form a glacier. ＿see: Means \u0026ldquo;lake\u0026rdquo;. ＿hütte SAC: \u0026ldquo;Hütte\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;hut\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;SAC\u0026rdquo; stands for \u0026ldquo;Swiss Alpine Club\u0026rdquo;; you can stay overnight at these. The food they provide is usually awesome as well. 10/10 would recommend.

Quick Summary #  Day hike from the Räterichsbodensee (near the Grimsel Pass) to the Bächlitalhütte SAC The starting point is easily accessible with both car and public transit Impressive glacial floodplain below the Bächlitalhütte The ascent and descent take the same path; there is only one officially marked path which leads to the Bächlitalhütte We\u0026rsquo;d suggest doing this hike when the ground is dry. While the hike itself isn\u0026rsquo;t very dangerous, most of the hike is on smooth rocks which can make the path quite slippery when wet  Ascent to the Bächlital # The dam at the end of the Räterichsbodensee. There is both a parking lot as well as the PostAuto stop right beside this dam. The path that leads to the Bächlitalhütte more or less goes straight up the side of the valley at the end of the dam. A view back down to the Räterichsbodensee. The alproses are still in full bloom. The clouds are a little unpredictable today. Regardless though, the intermittent periods of clear skies offer some great views down the valley. This gives a fairly good idea of what most of the path up to the Bächlisboden glacial runoff plain looks like. Most of the path is quite narrow and largely consists of these sorts of stone steps. A final view of the valley which leads up to the Grimsel Pass. The Räterichsbodensee is hiding beneath the clouds. Along the Bächlital # Turning 180\u0026#176; from where the previous picture was taken, we now have our first view into the Bächlital. Luckily, the clouds are still fairly low and haven't yet made their way into this side valley as a result. Making our way up the first part of the Bächlital. The path here is a lot less steep compared to the first part of the hike. The path is very well marked and is generally unproblematic. Our first view of the Bächlisboden glacial flood plain as well as the Bächlitalhütte SAC (perched up on the right-hand-side of the valley at the end of the plain). The majority of the path leading to the hut hugs the right side of the valley. Making our way along the right-hand side of the valley towards the Bächlitalhütte. This is the first part of the hike that wasn't quite as clearly marked as the rest. With that being said, there's only really one way you can go so it's not a big problem. Only one more short ascent to go until we've reached the hut. A quick look back down from where we've come from. The clouds are now slowly starting to creep into the Bächlital. This portion of the path is again very well marked. Similar to the first portion of the hike, the path consists mostly of stacked rocks (almost like stair steps) which makes the ascent pretty enjoyable. Looks kind of mysterious with those clouds... Venturing Beyond the Hut # After a relaxing coffee on the patio, we decided to make our way further up the Bächlital a little. We didn't really have a clear goal in mind, but we were curious if we'd get a break in the clouds further up the valley. A really beautiful path. The Bächligletscher at the end of the valley. We have it to thank for this absolutely spectacular valley. You often find moss campion in these rocky terrains where you wouldn't imaging anything would be capable of growing. Nature is truly amazing. After not having any luck with the clearing cloud cover, we decided to make our way back to the hut and return back to the Räterichsbodensee. A Foggy Return # The view from the patio of the Bächlitalhütte is really pretty spectacular. These sorts of braided river systems are typical to find in the mountains close to the melt of a glacier. And now back at the plain, back in rolls the fog. At least we were lucky enough to have an incredible view over the valley from our vantage point at the hut. This was the majority of the view for the way down. Not much to see, but still an enjoyable descent. As mentioned before though, watch out for moss covered rocks on the way down as some of them were quite slippery due to the fog (Bruno wiped out once on a large flat mossy rock on the descent). Back at the Räterichsbodensee. It's a bit of a shame that the weather didn't want to cooperate for the latter part of the day, but overall the hike was an absolute blast. This is definitely one we'll have to do again once in the future on a clearer day.
